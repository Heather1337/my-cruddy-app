Basic Idea:

Friends/Coworkers are constantly recommending (movies, tv shows, songs, books, places to visit, etc) YET we rarely can keep track or remember what it was they had recommended to us! I am creating an organized list site that allows for you to add/delete/comment on those recommendations. 

Input - Category box and Recommended Item box 
  - Ability to comment on items once added

Title will be for picking category that item belongs to (array)
  i.e. movies, songs, restaurants, places, books

Items will be what is added to each category array 
  i.e. Philz Coffee, Big Sur, Blue Lagoon, Les Miserables
